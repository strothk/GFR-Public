#Codebook for rawdat.csv

 Here are the data codes from the gravitational frame of reference experiment on you tube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9-Vqo_O--o).  Participants received extra credit in exchange for their participation. Each entry was transferred by hand, based on email responses.  The data includes two variables:
 
. Condition: Each participant was in one of two groups, condition A or condition B.    The condition was dictated by the month the participant was born in. Participants clicked on the link based on their birth month and emailed the results of their birth month and which side (the results). 
.	Side: This variable represents the results of the participant's visualization task. In this study, partipants were asked to visualize a person passing a ball to another person and then report which person passed the ball, (either the person on the left or right side).
