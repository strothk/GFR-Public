#Experiment on Gravitational Frame of Reference

###Krista Strother & Partner

##Introduction

This repository contains an empirical study on the effect of body posture on a visualization task. 

Remember, if you're wondering how I did something in the repository, take a look
at the code.

The data, analyses, images, and presentations all represent a reproducible real
world example. The data come from my
[YouTube experiment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9-Vqo_O--o). Data gathered via email from parcipants were processed and analyzed in R. Results of these analyses can be found in a poster.

##Guide to the Repository Contents
* **data**: a folder containing the following.
    * data file
        * rawdat.csv used to analyze the collected data.
    * code books that explain the data in the data files.
    * analysis files
        * analysis.Rmd: An R Markdown file that walks through my data analyses and creates the figure I used in my poster.
* **materials**: a folder containing materials used in the experiments. To minimize the size of this repository, many files used to create the videos are missing, but the end products can be found in the above link to the experiment.
    * WLMP files: The Movie Maker files I used to create the consent and experimental conditions.
    * Images used for the poster
    * A copy of the written Introduction, methods and IRB application information.
    * A link to the You Tube experiment.
* **presentation**: A folder containing the presentation poster.
